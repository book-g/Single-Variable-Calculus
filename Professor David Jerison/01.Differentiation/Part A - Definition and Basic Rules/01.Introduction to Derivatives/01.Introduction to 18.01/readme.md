### **Welcome to 18.01**  

Welcome to **18.01**. Today, we begin **Unit One**, focusing on **differentiation**.  

#### **Overview of the Unit**  
Over the next couple of weeks, we will explore:  
âœ… **What is a derivative?** â€“ Understanding derivatives from multiple perspectives.  
âœ… **Geometric Interpretation** â€“ Examining the derivative as the slope of a tangent line.  
âœ… **Physical Interpretation** â€“ Connecting derivatives to real-world applications.  
âœ… **Importance of Derivatives** â€“ Their role in science, engineering, economics, and beyond.  
âœ… **Differentiation Techniques** â€“ Learning how to differentiate any function.  

By the end of this unit, you will be able to compute derivatives of functions such as:  

$$f(x) = x \cdot \arctan(x) \quad \text{and} \quad f(x) = e^x$$  

Letâ€™s begin! ðŸš€
