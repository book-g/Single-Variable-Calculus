This lecture introduces the concept of derivatives in calculus, focusing on their geometric interpretation and practical applications. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the key points and tasks to help you understand the material:

---

### **1. Introduction to Derivatives**
- **Task**: Understand what a derivative is.
  - **Definition**: The derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x_0$, denoted $f'(x_0)$, represents the slope of the tangent line to the curve $y = f(x)$ at the point $(x_0, f(x_0))$.
  - **Geometric Interpretation**: The tangent line is the limit of secant lines as the second point on the curve approaches the point of tangency.
  - **Physical Interpretation**: Derivatives also represent rates of change, such as velocity in physics or growth rates in economics.

### **2. Notation for Derivatives**
- **Task**: Familiarize yourself with the different notations for derivatives.
  - **Newton's Notation**: $f'(x)$ or $y'$.
  - **Leibniz's Notation**: $\frac{df}{dx}$ or $\frac{dy}{dx}$.
  - Both notations are interchangeable and widely used in calculus.

---

### **3. Calculating Derivatives**
- **Task**: Learn how to compute derivatives using the limit definition.
  - The derivative is computed using the limit of the difference quotient:
    
    $$
    f'(x_0) = \lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x_0 + \Delta x) - f(x_0)}{\Delta x}.
    $$
 
  - This formula is the foundation for calculating derivatives of various functions.

### **4. Example 1: Derivative of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$**
- **Task**: Work through the calculation of the derivative of $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$.
  - Step 1: Write the difference quotient:
    
    $$
    \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{\frac{1}{x_0 + \Delta x} - \frac{1}{x_0}}{\Delta x}.
    $$
  
  - Step 2: Simplify the expression by combining the fractions:
   
    $$
    \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{-1}{(x_0 + \Delta x) x_0}.
    $$
 
  - Step 3: Take the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$:
  
    $$
    f'(x_0) = -\frac{1}{x_0^2}.
    $$
  
  - **Verification**: Check that the result makes sense geometrically (negative slope, less steep as $x_0$ increases).

### **5. Example 2: Derivative of $f(x) = x^n$**
- **Task**: Derive the power rule for derivatives.
  - Step 1: Write the difference quotient:
  
    $$
    \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = \frac{(x + \Delta x)^n - x^n}{\Delta x}.
    $$
  
  - Step 2: Expand $(x + \Delta x)^n$ using the binomial theorem:
   
    $$
    (x + \Delta x)^n = x^n + n x^{n-1} \Delta x + O((\Delta x)^2).
    $$
  
  - Step 3: Simplify the difference quotient:
    $$
    \frac{\Delta f}{\Delta x} = n x^{n-1} + O(\Delta x).
    $$
 
  - Step 4: Take the limit as $\Delta x \to 0$:
    $$
    f'(x) = n x^{n-1}.
    $$
  
  - **Power Rule**: $\frac{d}{dx} x^n = n x^{n-1}$.

### **6. Word Problem: Tangent Line and Area**
- **Task**: Solve the geometry problem involving the tangent line to $y = \frac{1}{x}$.
  - **Problem**: Find the area of the triangle formed by the axes and the tangent line to $y = \frac{1}{x}$ at a point $(x_0, y_0)$.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Find the equation of the tangent line using the derivative:
    
       $$
       y - y_0 = -\frac{1}{x_0^2} (x - x_0).
       $$
 
    2. Find the $x$-intercept (set $y = 0$):
    
       $$
       x = 2x_0.
       $$
  
    3. Find the $y$-intercept (set $x = 0$):
    
       $$
       y = 2y_0.
       $$
    
    4. Compute the area of the triangle:
    
       $$
       \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2x_0 \times 2y_0 = 2x_0 y_0 = 2.
       $$
  
  - **Conclusion**: The area is always 2, regardless of the point $(x_0, y_0)$.
