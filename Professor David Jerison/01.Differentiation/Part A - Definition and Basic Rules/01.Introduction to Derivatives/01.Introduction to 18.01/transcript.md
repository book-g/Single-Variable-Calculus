Welcome to 18.01
Welcome to 18.01. Today we start “Unit One”; the topic of the unit is differentiation. We’ll start by reviewing what’s in store in the next couple of weeks.
The topic of this lecture is “what is a derivative?” We’re going to look at this
question from several different points of view, and the first one is the geometric
interpretation. We’ll also discuss a physical interpretation.
Later we’ll learn what makes calculus so fundamental in science and engineering. Derivatives are important in all measurements – in science, in engineering,
in economics, in political science, in polling, in lots of commercial applications,
in just about everything.
In this unit we’ll also learn how to differentiate any function you know.
That’s a tall order, but by the end of the unit you will know how to take x·arctan(x) derivatives of functions like f(x) = e .
Let’s begin.
